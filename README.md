# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes Classifier

This is a simple sentiment analysis project that uses a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text samples into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing text samples and their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x and the required Python libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model is stored in the file big_sentiment_data.csv. It contains synthetic text samples and their associated sentiment labels.

Customization
You can customize the project according to your needs:

Use your own dataset: Replace big_sentiment_data.csv with your dataset containing text samples and sentiment labels.

Fine-tune the model: Experiment with different classifiers or adjust hyperparameters to improve the accuracy.

Acknowledgments
